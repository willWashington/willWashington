# 👋 Hi, I’m @willWashington
 
## 👀 I’m interested in:
* Anything to do with a Microsoft environment.
* Unity3D
* Game theory and design
* QA Automation (like Selenium)
* Financial markets and companies
* Space
* Anthropology
* Old stuff
* Sherlock (I'm an investigator at heart! 🧐)
* Lots of other geeky stuff!

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* MVU - Elm
* Razor
* New .NET 6 & 7 changes
* .NET Core Worker Services
* StockSharp (S#) - https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp
* FASTER NoDB - https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER
* Few other random things

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
* Implementing the Elm architecture in Unity 3D considering Mono - just a thought experiment I'm working on
* Unity 3D projects. Any indie devs or artists around?
* StockSharp. For.. reasons.
