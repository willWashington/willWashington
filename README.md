- 👋 Hi, I’m @willWashington
 
- 👀 I’m interested in anything to do with a Microsoft environment, apparently.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
-     MVU - Elm
-     Razor
-     New .NET 6 & 7 changes
-     .NET Core Worker Services
-     StockSharp (S#) - https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp
-     FASTER NoDB - https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER
-     Few other random things

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
-     Implementing the Elm architecture in Unity 3D considering Mono - just a thought experiment I'm working on
-     Unity 3D projects. Any indie devs or artists around?
-     StockSharp. For.. reasons.

- 📫 You can reach me at william.washington@live.com
